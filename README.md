# MovieMe
Movie App Group Project - Olyvia Hix and Haley Fisher

MovieMe is a spin-off app of Netflix. It allows you to search for any movie you think of and add it to a "Watch Wishlist" for a time when you want to watch a specific movie but either don't have the time, or just want to save it for a future watch. You can also add movies to a "Watched" list, for when you complete a movie and want to put it on the completed list. There is a delete button in each list that allows you to delete the movie from the list that you have it in, in case you accidently added it to the list, or no longer want it on whichever list it was added to. We incorporated a Navbar that has a contact us page, as well as a Movie Night tab. That tab allows you to click a button and the app will randomly pick a movie from the API that we are pulling data from. This is nice for those of you who cannot decide what to watch, or just want a nice suprise to watch! 

The technologies that were used in this group project are are JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project is a front end only project, so when you refresh, you will lose what you have put into your lists. 

Some challenges that we faced during this project were learning to impliment JavaScript into an app, and learning on click functions that actually move things from one place to another. 

Some favorite aspects of this project that we incorporated are the scroll bar that allows you to scroll left and right to view more movies, and the simple yet eye catching styling that we added. In our NavBar, there is a tab called MovieNight. That allows you to click the button and it will randomly select a movie for you if you cant decide what to watch. Helpful for our indecisive folks!

We plan on working on this project more so that you can save data, and even log in so you can have a profile with your information.

# How To Run MovieMe

If working in VSCode, in our Index.html file, right click anywhere and "Run With Live Server". This will start the app in the browser and run it live.

# How To Use MovieMe

While in the project, search for movie titles in the search box and hit the search button. There it will list any movie with those words in the title and display them from left to right in a scroll container. Each movie will have a button to add to watch wishlist, or add to watched list. If you do either of those commands, it will show below the scroll container, the movie name that you have added to the specific list. You can then delete them from each list if you choose. There is also a contact us page in where you can put in your information and a note for use (suggestion, comment, concerns) and also a tab called MovieNight. Click the button to have the app call the API and randomly choose a movie and display it as a suggested movie to watch for movie night with the family!

# Contributers

Myself and Haley Fisher were the sole contributers to this project. We did a lot of the HTML together, Haley contributed to a lot of the JavaScript, and I contributed to the CSS.
